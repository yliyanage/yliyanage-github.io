    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">This paper presents a complete real-time implementation of a Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM) system that, is robust under residential voltage level fluctuations. Existing NIALM techniques rely on multiple measurements taken at high sampling rates, but, only have been proven in simulated environments without even considering the effect of residential voltage level fluctuations - which is a severe problem in power systems of most developing countries like Sri Lanka. In contrast, through the NIALM method proposed in this paper, accurate load monitoring results were obtained in realtime using only smart meter measurements taken at a low sampling rate from a real appliance setup under residential voltage level fluctuations. In the proposed NIALM method, initially in the learning phase, a properly constructed MATLABTM Graphical User Interface (GUI) was used to acquire signals of each appliance active power consumption and voltage levels. Then, obtained active power measurements were separated into subspace components (SCs) via the Karhunen Loeve&rsquo; Expansion (KLE) while also taking the voltage variations into account. Using those SCs, a unique information rich appliance level signature database was constructed and it was then used to obtain the signatures for all possible device combinations. Next, a separate GUI was designed to identify the turned ON appliance combination in the current time window using the pre-constructed signature databases, after reading the total residential active power consumption and the supply voltage. To validate the proposed real-time NIALM implementation, data from a laboratory arrangement consisting of ten household appliances was used. From the results, it was found that the proposed method is capable of accurately identifying the turned on appliances even under severe residential supply voltage level fluctuations.</p>
