Due to the significant impact of road accidents on health and development, early and accurate detection of accidents is crucial. To address this issue, a novel Bayesian quickest change detection formulation is introduced, which considers both average detection delay and false alarm rate. The optimum strategy is derived via dynamic programming and shown to compare a recursively computed statistic with a function of false alarm to identify accidents as they happen. Considering that post-accident conditions are typically not known, two methods are proposed that recursively estimate multiple unknown parameters during the accident detection process. Further, four aggregation methods are proposed to improve performance exploiting spatial correlations between sensors. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate improvement up to 65.2% and 87.2% in average detection delay and false alarm rate, respectively, against prior work.","tags":["\"Accidents;Traffic control;Delays;Computational modeling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Feature extraction;Collision detection;Bayesian sequential detection;unknown post change distribution;sensor decisions aggregation.\""],"title":"Near Real-Time Freeway Accident Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I.

First, nonlinear dynamic model of the system was derived using basic laws of physics. While it was possible to linearize some of the plant nonlinearities, some of them were not, such as squared input. In the conventional approach, this problem has been solved by linearizing the possible nonlinearities, while neglecting the others, at the cost of reduced performance. Most importantly, the latter partially linearized approach demands linearized plant model at every operating point, which makes the controller implementation complicated when considering a wide dynamic operating range. In order to overcome limitations of the partially linearized approach, we derive a nonlinear controller. In that we use the tracking error dynamics to arrive at a compromise between the tracking performances of the pitch and yaw axes control and the smoothness of the actuator input. Furthermore, one of the key features of twin rotor MIMO system is its dynamic cross coupling. Therefore, in order to get rid of the cross coupling a dynamic de-coupler was used. First the plant and the controller was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink™ environment. Then, it was implemented in the hardware to control the pitch and yaw of an actual Twin Rotor MIMO system. The performance assessed using Integrated Absolute Error (IAE) and Accumulated Squared Input (ASI) metrics which represents the tracking performance and the energy input respectively. The performance matrices of the controller were compared with a PID controller tuned to the partially linearized plant model and the results show approximately more than 25% improvement both in terms of IAE and ASI.","tags":["actuators;control nonlinearities;control system synthesis;linearisation techniques;MIMO systems;nonlinear control systems;nonlinear dynamical systems;pitch control (position);rotors (mechanical);nonlinear dynamic model;plant nonlinearities;partially linearized approach;controller implementation;nonlinear controller;tracking error dynamics;actuator input;dynamic cross coupling;energy input;twin rotor MIMO system;yaw control;pitch control;twin rotor multiinput-multioutput control system;accumulated squared input metrics;Mathematical model;Rotors;Transmission line measurements;DC motors;Control systems;Transfer functions;MIMO communication;Error dynamics;MIMO system;Nonlinear control"],"title":"Yaw and pitch control of a twin rotor MIMO system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

Existing NIALM techniques rely on multiple measurements taken at high sampling rates, but, only have been proven in simulated environments without even considering the effect of residential voltage level fluctuations - which is a severe problem in power systems of most developing countries like Sri Lanka. In contrast, through the NIALM method proposed in this paper, accurate load monitoring results were obtained in realtime using only smart meter measurements taken at a low sampling rate from a real appliance setup under residential voltage level fluctuations. In the proposed NIALM method, initially in the learning phase, a properly constructed MATLABTM Graphical User Interface (GUI) was used to acquire signals of each appliance active power consumption and voltage levels. Then, obtained active power measurements were separated into subspace components (SCs) via the Karhunen Loeve' Expansion (KLE) while also taking the voltage variations into account. Using those SCs, a unique information rich appliance level signature database was constructed and it was then used to obtain the signatures for all possible device combinations. Next, a separate GUI was designed to identify the turned ON appliance combination in the current time window using the pre-constructed signature databases, after reading the total residential active power consumption and the supply voltage. To validate the proposed real-time NIALM implementation, data from a laboratory arrangement consisting of ten household appliances was used. From the results, it was found that the proposed method is capable of accurately identifying the turned on appliances even under severe residential supply voltage level fluctuations.","tags":["domestic appliances;graphical user interfaces;power consumption;power measurement;smart meters;real-time nonintrusive appliance load monitoring system;active power measurements;Sri Lanka;smart meter measurement;Matlab;graphical user interface;Karhunen Loeve expansion;household appliances;accurate load monitoring results;NIALM techniques;residential voltage level fluctuations;supply voltage fluctuations;severe residential supply voltage level fluctuations;real-time NIALM implementation;total residential active power consumption;unique information rich appliance level signature database;appliance active power consumption;NIALM method;Real-time systems;Voltage measurement;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Voltage fluctuations;Home appliances;Power measurement;Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM);Real-time load monitoring;Voltage Fluctuations;Realtime NIALM;Smart meters;Subspace technique;Smart Grid;Demand Side Management(DSM)"],"title":"Real-time non-intrusive appliance load monitoring under supply voltage fluctuations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chinthaka Dinesh","Shirantha Welikala","Yasitha Liyanage","Mervyn Parakrama B.

Then, in order to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed NILM method, it was employed on a set of 400 individual households. From that, reliable estimations were obtained for the total residential solar generation and for the total load that can be shed to provide reserve services.

The primary focus of the proposed INS is to provide a logical, computationally efficient algorithm which serves as a basis to map and navigate unknown environments. For demonstrative and testing purposes, the INS was implemented both in simulation form using MATLABTM™ SIMULINK™ as well as practically, using an omni-directional robot (ODR) platform. The INS requires input data acquired from a stereo vision system mounted on the ODR, and functions by employing a spatial information spectrum of its surrounding using the data acquired by the vision system. This proposed information spectrum is a novel tool that conveys the already identified objects and information gaps (pathways the robot can travel through, to obtain more information about the unknown environment) within the vicinity of the robot, to the INS. The INS then decides the most efficient way to map and traverse this unknown environment based on this information spectrum. Experiments were carried out in a multitude of simulated environments. Metrics such as time taken to completely map these environments and the information gathered within a given time, were used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. A further extension to this algorithm is proposed to handle dynamic and moving obstacles in unknown environments.","tags":["collision avoidance;mobile robots;robot vision;stereo image processing;intelligent navigation system;INS;unknown environment mapping;autonomous robots;MATLABTM SIMULINK;omnidirectional robot platform;ODR platform;stereo vision system;spatial information spectrum;information gaps;dynamic obstacle handling;moving obstacle handling;Navigation;Robot sensing systems;Robot kinematics;Collision avoidance;Mobile robots;Intelligent navigation;Mapping;Vision;Path planning;Autonomous reconnaissance"],"title":"Intelligent Navigation System for mapping unknown environments","type":"publication"}]
